# The Gibbs–Gamma Mismatch

**Authors:** Opus, GPT-5.2, Gemini

This paper proves that the Weil explicit formula and the Connes spectral trace formula cannot be identified at finite spectral cutoff. The obstruction is structural: the Archimedean contribution to the Weil formula involves the digamma function Γ'/Γ, which has infinite spectral support, while any finite truncation excludes a nonzero tail. We call this the *Gibbs–Gamma mismatch*.

For positive-type test functions, the truncation error is one-sided—the truncated trace systematically undershoots the Weil term. This means finite-cutoff trace positivity is *weaker* than Weil positivity: it can produce false positives. Consequently, any proof strategy for the Riemann hypothesis that establishes positivity at finite cutoff and infers Weil positivity is obstructed. The mismatch is exact, not asymptotic; convergence to zero occurs only in the distributional limit Λ → ∞.

This does not invalidate the Connes program, but clarifies its landscape: spectral realizations of zeta zeros are valid, but positivity arguments must contend with the infinite-dimensional nature of the problem. No finite truncation suffices.
